# data-mining-2026

This repository supports the course **Data Mining** from Universidad Anáhuac Mayab.

It contains:

- Starter code used during lectures
- Datasets for in-class activities
- Templates for team deliverables
- Submission guidelines
- Branch policy documentation

From Session 13 onward, all practical work must be submitted via GitHub following the branch policy described in `00_course_info/BRANCH_POLICY.md`.

---

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the structured application of data mining techniques for engineering and business decision-making.

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

- Design structured and reproducible data mining workflows
- Prepare, clean, and validate datasets
- Apply clustering and pattern discovery techniques
- Build predictive models (Decision Trees, Regression, Neural Networks)
- Evaluate model performance
- Implement structured submission workflows using Git

## Submission Workflow (After Midterm 1)

1. Pull latest changes from `main`
2. Switch to your team branch
3. Develop your solution inside your team folder
4. Commit and push your branch
5. Open a Pull Request to `main`

Full instructions are available in:

```text
00_course_info/HOW_TO_SUBMIT.md
```

---

## Important Rules

- Do not push directly to `main`
- Do not modify instructor files
- Do not modify datasets unless explicitly instructed
- Always ensure your code runs before submitting
- Write clean, readable, well-structured Python code

---

## Course Philosophy

This course is not about memorizing algorithms. It is about:

- Understanding data
- Thinking structurally
- Making decisions based on evidence
- Writing clean, reproducible code
- Collaborating professionally using Git

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:

- Take a screenshot of your terminal
- Clearly describe the error
- Indicate what you already tried
- Ask during class or contact the instructor

---

Let’s build intelligent systems responsibly and structurally.
